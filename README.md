Algorithm I wrote for my classes for finding maxiumum value of third degree polynomial for x in range of 0 to 31 and entered parameters A, B, C, D (for Ax^3 + Bx^2 + Cx + D).

Genetic algorithms, inspired by the process of natural selection, are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on biologically inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.
